# IoT_Device_Monitoring_System_2019-20
This is the repository for the final project carried out by graduate students at San Jose State University.  
With the increased need for IoT devices, it has become a challenge to monitor them.
Earlier this Monitoring and Controlling was done individually based on the IoT device categories. 
So, as the number of IoT devices increased in the industry we need a reliable and centralized system to monitor and control them. 
Also, we require a system that is cost-effective and can provide solutions for major issues. 
So, we propose a system that will provide a common platform to monitor the IoT devices and an agent software which will be installed on the IoT devices to collect the data from the local sensor and transfer it to the centralized cloud-based web application. 
The project focuses on creating a global IoT device monitoring and controlling application to detect uptime of the connected devices, control each IoT device and provide an alerting mechanism for the downtime of end devices to make sure the downtime of the devices is addressed in a timely manner. 
We will be able to give the command through the web application to Agent which is installed on the local machine to control the local peripherals.
